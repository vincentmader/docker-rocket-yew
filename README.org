When you wish to run the server and/or client locally without making use of Docker,
there are a few things you should do:

1. Install WebAssembly target.
#+begin_src shell
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
#+end_src

2. Install `trunk`.
#+begin_src shell
  cargo install --locked trunk
#+end_src
